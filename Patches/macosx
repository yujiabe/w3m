Subject: w3m 0.1.6 on Mac OS X
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi,

I've compiled w3m successfully on Mac OS X (DP3).  I'm including
patches, mainly dealing with compiler complaints about possible use of
uninitialized data.

It compiles with one warning, still:

url.c:799: warning: variable `p' might be clobbered by `longjmp' or
           `vfork'


On a related note: I had to modify the makefile; there is no `m'
library, and no `termcap' library, and they're not needed as well --
but they will cause an ld failure, when present on the ld command line.

Context diffs (against a 21/1/2000 0.1.6) are included, including the
(trivial) patch to make Boehm gc compile.
